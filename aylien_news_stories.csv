6597941733,The Single Company Warren Buffett Seems To Think You Should Invest In,2024-03-11T14:52:53Z,"Alex Wong / Getty Images Alex Wong / Getty Images For all the sage advice that Warren Buffett freely dispenses, it seems as if his
personal investment philosophy violates the basic strategy that most financial advisors offer their clients, which is to have a diversified portfolio. Although Buffett’s total investment in Occidental Petroleum is “only” 4.2% of Berkshire’s investment portfolio, it amounts to 28.2% of OXY’s entire share count. However, if you’re a believer that oil and gas companies are decades away from being replaced by “clean energy” ones, that carbon management will turn into a big business for OXY, and/or that its free cash flow will allow it to make strategic moves that it can leverage into greater profitability, Occidental Petroleum might deserve a space in your portfolio. CrownRock Acquisition Occidental’s announcement that it was going to purchase CrownRock in Dec. 2023 was huge news, and the terms of the deal were enough to encourage Buffett to purchase an additional $588 million OXY shares. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.

6597938260,WA expanding health care options for undocumented immigrants,2024-03-11T14:51:44Z,"By  OLYMPIA — By the close of Washington's legislative session last week, state lawmakers had added more funding to help reduce health care
insurance costs for undocumented immigrants, as the state also prepares to expand Apple Health, its free or low-cost health insurance, to the same population in July.
  This year, the Legislature added $28.4 million, nearly twice as much as its first allocation of such funding during the 2023 session, to continue helping the 16,000 individuals who applied for coverage during the recent enrollment period, which ended Jan. 15.
   Each undocumented individual can get up to $250 off their monthly cost when purchasing private health care insurance through Healthplanfinder, according to Genevieve Arredondo, associate director of outreach at Washington Health Benefit Exchange.
   The waiver meant undocumented immigrants could apply for Medicaid or shop for private health care insurance through Healthplanfinder , the website to apply for health care in Washington.
   Many low-income undocumented immigrants can't afford to pay hundreds of dollars a month in premiums just to access health care, said Catalina Velasquez, the executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network, who marched last month in Olympia to advocate for health care and unemployment benefits for undocumented immigrants.
   In May 2022, Washington was the first state to file a waiver application to allow undocumented immigrants to buy private health insurance; a year later, the waiver was approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of the Treasury.

6597926890,Is GameFi subject to the same market forces as the traditional game industry?,2024-03-11T14:48:08Z,"Web2 games and GameFi might differ in several key areas, but many of the market forces that govern success or failure are very much the same — at least according to several experts who spoke with Cointelegraph.

 All games are governed by stickiness and profitability

Roy Kek, co-founder and CEO of Singaporean gaming and esports company Emerge Group, told Cointelegraph that Web2 and Web3 are governed by the same market forces and measures for success.

 Rather than moving away from its core focus and shifting to the traditional gaming market models of mass production to survive long term, Koh thinks a smaller, more subtle change is required for Web3 games and GameFi in general.

 

Using some elements from the Web2 game market, GameFi combines traditional gaming elements with blockchain technology, allowing for ownership of in-game items and rewards in digital assets, such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs).

 “The Web3 gaming industry has to acknowledge that, without a dedicated player community, any game, whether traditional or blockchain-based, faces challenges in achieving sustained success and optimal NFT or token sales.”",44,"N242939029377741109627296243427746154124, N26249220812379629025728652707592773328, N221413921599663279783476021896862623594, N103286917845964083195474716203785710155, N139733083406462677380756564717939974842, N17897343319820629256039946210330660052, Q353534, N246158801684494422326308972978693299133, N330630706149174716262436831881458977569, N234602319438187633541809977314667460081, N116692886150482570631610736180866849655, Q312, Q334, N208040303371831407528496689365421694176, Q2333891, N153615093972686116576671770892799033594, N213044030919909654048638877338796430653, Q5359555, Q286642, Q289845, Q582169, N251064883169212795997018618369056105830, N1227820337872298163665244585914297421, N228703891627320240651762402932842955112, Q95, N227609581817006646490267919141904270979, N213416779691095327055525194197411201934, N244944148095959913142079038742686439101","N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A","AAPL, GOOG",neutral,N/A,neutral,N/A,"IAB3, IAB3-11, IAB9, IAB9-25, 04000000, 04016000, 04016029, ay.biz, ay.biz.sectors","Business, Marketing, Hobbies & Interests, Roleplaying Games, economy, business and finance, company information, marketing, Business and Commerce, Sector and Industry Trends","Roy Kek, ecosystem, Senet, Overall, Emerge Group, Web2, NFTs, game, Steam, Additionally, SteamDB, Statista, esports, Acxyn, Monetization, Mohsin Waqar, “Ultimately, However, counterparts, market, creativity, monetization, Andy Koh, AAA, traditional, liquidity, CEO, Cointelegraph, Exploding Topics, Koh, Waqar, formidable, Web3, John Schneider, games, Rather, gaming, Kek, digital assets, GameFi, NFT, microtransactions, revamp, Stickiness, mass production, success, Speaking, farming, sustainability",https://cointelegraph.com/news/gamefi-market-game-industry-development

6597926586,"Age verification should be Apple’s job, says Tinder parent Match",2024-03-11T14:48:05Z,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has argued that for age-restricted apps, age verification should be Apple’s job. Yoel Roth – who formerly had the same role in Twitter – said that Apple and Google are in a better position to accurately assess the age of their smartphone users …

‘Age verification should be Apple’s job’

This view was first voiced by Meta in November of last year.

 In pre-prepared testimony, Meta’s Zuckerberg called for lawmakers to instead mandate regulation requiring Apple and Google app stores to verify the age of younger users.

 We’re going to keep doing what we’re doing here to keep underage users off of the platforms, but I’d like to see these challenges moved a bit upstream so we have better tools and signals to do that work.

Asked whether than meant Match wanted to pass the buck to Apple and Google, offloading the company’s responsibility, Roth said it was a question of which company was better placed to do the job.

 So as self-serving as these arguments may be, I do think that having Apple and Google perform age-verification – and allow or block all age-restricted apps on that basis – is the better approach.

6597917562,YouTuber fires .50 caliber bullet at Cybertruck to test its bullet proof metal,2024-03-11T14:45:21Z,"A YouTuber has decided to pull Tesla's claims about the Cybertruck being bulletproof to the test by firing various rounds at its stainless steel exterior.

 The Cybertruck's stainless steel alloy prevented each of the shots from going through the metal, proving Tesla's claims that the Cybertruck is ""bulletproof"". Firstly, the YouTuber fires a 9mm handgun at the Cybertruck with 115-grain full metal jacket bullets. Moving onto faster bullets, the YouTuber tests a 4.5 mm round, and an AR 5.56mm round, which both penetrated the metal exterior. The last test was easily the most interesting as a .50 caliber round was fired at the Cybertruck and unsurprisingly passing through both sides of the door.

Mora said the border crisis is partially to blame for the assault as New York City, in particular, battles an influx of illegal immigrants.

 ""I think these soft-on-crime laws that are being implemented aren't helping us, like citizens of New York, [and] aren't helping healthcare staff in dealing with these types of criminals.""

the big winner at the Academy Awards on Sunday, picking up seven Oscars, including best picture, for Oppenheimer.
   It was a quieter year for the streaming giants, with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX , ETR:NFC) taking home a single award for Wes Anderson's short film The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar.
  Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL , ETR:APC) was less fortunate, failing to take home any awards despite it releasing best picture nominee Killers of the Flower Moon.
   Co's (NYSE:DIS, ETR:WDP) Searchlight division picked up five Oscars, with the feature film Poor Things taking home four including Best Actress for Emma Stone's performance.
   Universal's independent film studio Focus Features also picked up an award with its comedy-drama The Holdovers after Da'Vine Joy Randolph won Best Supporting Actress for her role as Mary Lamb.
   Currently, Universal's US-only service Peacock is streaming Oppenheimer, but should a lucky streamer like Netflix get the rights to release it globally, it could provide a boost in users and revenues.

6597895824,Quizartinib approved to treat adult patients with a type of blood cancer,2024-03-11T14:38:29Z,"AML is a type of blood cancer, which progresses quickly and aggressively, and requires immediate treatment. Patients were randomised to receive either quizartinib (268 patients) or a placebo (271 patients) once daily for two weeks in each 28-day treatment cycle in combination with standard chemotherapy, followed by either quizartinib or placebo once daily for up to 36 cycles of 28 days.

 Following completion of chemotherapy, the doctor may continue the patient’s treatment with quizartinib.

 This regulatory approval is supported by evidence from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial involving 539 adult patients (aged between 18 and 75 years) newly diagnosed with FLT3-ITD positive AML.

 The most common side effects of the medicine (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) include abnormal liver enzymes, low levels of blood platelets, anaemia, low levels of certain white blood cells, diarrhoea, nausea, stomach pain, headache, vomiting, swelling (face, arms and legs), nose and throat infection, decreased appetite, severe nosebleeds, fungal infections, herpes infections, indigestion and bacteria in the blood.

The Toyota Land Cruiser is coming back! Luxury seekers will also find single options and packages for additional creature comforts.

2024 Toyota Land Cruiser trim levels

Starting at $55,590, the 2024 Land Cruiser will be available in three distinct grades: the standard Land Cruiser; the 1958, paying homage to the vehicle’s debut year in North America; and the First Edition, which includes exclusive features and design elements.

 Originally positioning the Land Cruiser for its ability to transport passengers on all off-road terrains, Toyota upscaled the brand with standard luxury features when SUVs became mainstream vehicles in the 1990s.

 Hybrid power ready for off-road adventure

The 2024 Land Cruiser rides on the TNGA-F global truck platform, shared with other robust Toyota models such as the Tundra, Sequoia, and Tacoma. Two years after Toyota removed its flagship SUV from the U.S. market, the 2024 Land Cruiser will be in dealerships this Spring.

6597890164,Only in Oklahoma: Briggs built up Enid college,2024-03-11T14:36:38Z,"Educator Eugene S. Briggs, who was known as the ""builder president"" of the former Phillips University, got a practical education in Oklahoma politics early in his career. Meanwhile, Briggs earned a doctor's degree at Columbia University in New York, served as president of Christian College at Columbia, Mo., and in 1938 became the third president of Phillips University at Enid, where he remained for 23 years.
